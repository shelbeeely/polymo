/**
 * Everything the pet has been allowed to do, and everything it has not.
 *
 * **The general answer to a shape that bit three times in one day.** First run
 * asks for each grant at the step that needs it, which DESIGN.md §5.2 requires
 * and which is right — but first run finishes once, and until this page it was
 * the only place any of them was ever requested. A step skipped meant a grant
 * lost, permanently, with nothing anywhere admitting it. Two recovery rows had
 * been built by hand, one per feature, and a third feature was still broken.
 *
 * **It reports rather than nags**, so it does not become the barrage §5.2
 * forbids: nothing here asks for anything until it is tapped.
 *
 * **Rows, not switches, and that is a platform fact rather than a preference.**
 * Android has no way for an app to hand a permission back —
 * `revokeSelfPermissionOnKill` applies by killing the process, and the listener
 * binding and usage appop have no revoke at all. A switch that will not go back,
 * or that snaps back after being tapped, is the same lie as a *Loaded* badge
 * over a model that failed. [PermissionInventory] has the reasoning.
 *
 * **It re-reads on resume**, because two of the six are granted in another app
 * entirely and the page would otherwise contradict a change just made.
