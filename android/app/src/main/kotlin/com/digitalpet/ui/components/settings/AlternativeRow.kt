 * [ModelSettingsScreen][com.digitalpet.ui.settings.ModelSettingsScreen]'s
 * doc comment), but the design system still names `settings/AlternativeRow`
 * in its component roster (`components.txt`, checked by `ComponentRosterTest`),
 * and that roster is the design project's call to make, not this codebase's —
 * see CLAUDE.md §7.2. Removing this file without the design system agreeing

 * The trailing pill on an [AlternativeRow]: *Load*, *Loaded*, or unloadable.

 * **Its geometry does not vary with its state**, which is the whole point — the
 * design's `7/16` padding on a fully rounded shape, whatever the colours say. A
 * row's height therefore cannot depend on whether its model happens to be the
 * loaded one.
 *
 * **The tap target is the design's 30dp rather than the [PetSize.touchMin] 48
 * that DESIGN.md §6 asks for**, and that is a deliberate exception rather than
 * an oversight: forcing 48 here would add 12dp to every row in the list to serve
 * one control, and the pill is wide and sits inside a 52dp row with nothing else
 * tappable near it. If it proves fiddly, the fix is to grow the row, not to make
 * the two states different shapes again.
 *
 * Private on purpose. It is not a component in its own right — it is this row's
 * trailing state, and the design system draws it inside `AlternativeRow.jsx`
 * rather than beside it.
