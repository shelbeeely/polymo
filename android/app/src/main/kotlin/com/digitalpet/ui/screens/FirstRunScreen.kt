/**
 * First run — DESIGN.md §5.2, and the last unbuilt flow in §5.
 *
 * **The design system draws no screen for this**, and §7.4 records it as
 * undrawn. So it follows the frame the rest of the app already uses — the
 * screen margin, the type scale, the same pet panel the main surface leads with
 * — rather than inventing a look. That is the precedent Appearance set: a screen
 * the design does not cover copies the ones it does.
 *
 * **It adds no components**, deliberately. Under §7.2 the design system decides
 * what components exist, and it has no card for anything in here; inventing one
 * would put a twentieth entry in a roster `ComponentRosterTest` pins at
 * nineteen. Everything below is either a shared component or this screen's own
 * arrangement, which is §6.3's rule: a screen's own flow is not a component.
 *
 * ### What this screen actually does
 *
 * Very little, and that is the design. **Two of the five steps cannot be
 * completed here** — pairing happens on *Your pet* and models are imported on
 * *Local AI models* — so the flow hands off and you come back. Because
 * `FirstRun` derives the step from what is true, coming back with the work done
 * simply *is* progress; nothing reports completion, so nothing can forget to.
 *
 * ### Leaving is a first-class outcome
 *
 * §5.2: *a run that stops at step 2 has still achieved something.* There is a
 * way out of every step after the welcome, and taking it is not a failure state
 * — the main surface reports each of these conditions in the place that fixes
 * it, which it did before this screen existed.
 *
 * ### Two cases worth knowing about, both checked rather than assumed
 *
 * **An existing install sees the welcome once and nothing else.** The finished
 * flag is a new preference, so it is false for everyone on the update that
 * brings this; every step after the welcome is already satisfied, so
 * acknowledging it makes the step `null` and the flow ends on the same tap. That
 * was preferred to seeding the flag from "a pet is already paired": the
 * heuristic is one more thing that can be wrong, and what it saves is a single
 * tap on a screen that introduces something new.
 *
 * **A configured device does not flash the models step while its brain loads.**
 * `readiness` folds `Unloaded` to `Missing`, and a multi-gigabyte model takes
 * seconds — but `ModelRepository.restoreLlm` dispatches `loadModel` at
 * construction, so a remembered model reports `Loading` within a dispatch and
 * `Loading` satisfies the step. `Missing` therefore means what it says: no file.
