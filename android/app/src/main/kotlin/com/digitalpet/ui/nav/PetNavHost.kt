/**
 * The app's shell.
 *
 * **NO BOTTOM BAR AND NO SCAFFOLD.** Both existed to hold a navigation bar and
 * an input row above it; the Claude Design surface has neither — the transcript
 * and its input live in a sheet on the main screen, so the shell's only job is
 * the back stack. That also removes the window-inset problem the previous
 * arrangement was working around.
 *
 * **THE VIEWMODELS ARE HOISTED HERE**, and this matters more now than it did
 * with two tabs. Calling `hiltViewModel()` inside each `composable { }` scopes
 * the instance to that back-stack entry, so every settings sub-page would get
 * its *own* `PetChatViewModel` — a fresh set of flow subscriptions each time
 * somebody opened a chip. Taking them once here gives every destination the same
 * instance. The conversation itself was never at risk (it lives in
 * `PetConversationEngine` on a process scope), which is exactly why the waste
 * would have been invisible.
