/**
 * The main surface — Claude Design `Digital Pet - Main Surface`, screens 2a/2b.
 *
 * **ONE SURFACE, NOT TWO.** The transcript is a sheet at the bottom of this
 * screen rather than a destination of its own, which supersedes DESIGN.md §5.1's
 * "two destinations and a settings route" and removes the bottom navigation
 * added on 2026-08-05. The design's own title is "One main surface", and the
 * reasoning §5.1 gave for separating them still holds — a conversation normally
 * runs between the pet's microphone and speaker with the phone in a pocket — it
 * simply argues for the transcript being *secondary* rather than *elsewhere*.
 *
 * Reading order down the screen is the order of the questions someone actually
 * asks: who is this and is it alright (header), can it reach me and can it think
 * (chips), what does it look like (panel), how is it (care), what did it say
 * (sheet).
 *
 * **2a and 2b are the same composable.** The dark screen differs only by colour
 * scheme plus the mic becoming a stop button while recording, so there is one
 * implementation and the theme does the rest.
 *
 * **This file composes; it does not draw.** Every box on it — the header, the
 * chips, the panel, the care card, the input, the suggestions — is a component
 * in `ui/components/`, named as the design system names it. It was not always
 * so: five of them were `private fun`s here, which is one of the four causes of
 * drift DESIGN.md §7.7 lists. What is left in this file is the arrangement and
 * the sheet's arithmetic, which is genuinely this screen's own.

             *   was pushed a further 841 px above that.
             * - **The sheet stayed put and the keyboard covered it.** With the
             *   window not resizing, padding only the footer leaves the sheet
             *   where it was — its collapsed peek runs 1557..2142 and the

/**
 * What goes inside the sheet.

 * **This is what replaced the Talk tab.** The conversation is how the pet talks,
 * not the product (DESIGN.md §1), so it belongs underneath how the pet is rather
 * than beside it — and a sheet says "underneath" in a way a tab of equal weight
 * could not.
 *
 * THE SHEET HOLDS THE TRANSCRIPT AND NOTHING ELSE. The input is a fixed footer
 * outside it (see the Surface in PetHomeScreen), because a bottom sheet reveals
 * its content from the top and anything else in here would compete with the
 * conversation for that band — as well as moving with the sheet, when the whole
 * point of it is to be reachable in every sheet position.
 *
 * **NOTHING IN HERE CHANGES SIZE.** It used to hold two differently
 * sized copies of the transcript and cross-fade between them when the sheet
 * settled; the transcript is now one list at one height, *moved* by a
 * `graphicsLayer` translation. See [ChatSheetGeometry] for what the translation
 * is and why — it is where the sheet's last three faults were, and it is tested.
