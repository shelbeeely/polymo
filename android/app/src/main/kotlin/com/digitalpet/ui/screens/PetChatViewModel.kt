/**
 * The screen's view of the pet. Not the conversation itself.
 *
 * A conversation with the pet runs entirely between the pet's own microphone,
 * speaker and screen, so it must not depend on this class existing —
 * [PetConversationEngine] owns it on a process-lifetime scope, and this
 * ViewModel observes and forwards. See that class for what went wrong when the
 * pipeline lived here.
 *
 * What legitimately belongs here is anything that only means something with a UI
 * present: the phone's own microphone (a fallback for when the pet is not
 * around), model management for the debug panels, BLE pairing, the debug drawer.
