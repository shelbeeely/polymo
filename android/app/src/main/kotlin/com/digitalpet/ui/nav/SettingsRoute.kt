/**
 * Settings as a small tree — Claude Design 2c/2d/2e.
 *
 * **This is what deletes `EmbeddedPanel`.** The single-page Settings built on
 * 2026-08-04 had to bound each panel's height, because three of them contain a
 * `LazyColumn` and a scrollable inside a scrolling page gets infinite
 * constraints. Giving each panel its own screen removes the nesting entirely,
 * which is what DESIGN.md §6.5 step 2 said would happen.
 *
 * The index exists for the gear. The two chips on the main surface skip it and
 * open their section directly.

 * are "a theme"; the third is a decision not to have an opinion. A two-position
 * switch would have to either drop that or smuggle it in as a second control,
 * and "follow the system" is the default, so it cannot be the one that is hard
 * to express.

 * The whole row is the target rather than just the button — `selectableGroup`
 * plus `selectable`, with the `RadioButton` given a null `onClick` so it draws
 * the state without competing for the tap.

 * > which carries no state, and a sibling `View` that carries it — and
 * > `Role.RadioButton` maps a Compose `selected` onto the platform's
 * > **`checked`**, not its `selected`. Reading the first node's `selected`
