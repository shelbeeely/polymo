/**
 * Where you can be in this app.
 *
 * **ONE SURFACE AND A SETTINGS TREE**, as of the Claude Design implementation
 * (2026-08-06). DESIGN.md §5.1 originally specified two destinations — Pet and
 * Talk — with the transcript as a tab of its own. The design supersedes that:
 * the transcript is a sheet on the main surface, so there is nothing to
 * navigate *between* at the top level and the bottom bar is gone.
 *
 * §5.1's reasoning survives the change rather than being overturned by it. It
 * argued the transcript is "the one surface that is usually not needed", because
 * a conversation normally runs between the pet's own microphone and speaker with
 * the phone in a pocket. That is an argument for the transcript being
 * *secondary*, and a sheet expresses that better than a tab of equal weight did.
 *
 * Settings is now a small tree rather than one scrolling page, which is what
 * finally kills the `EmbeddedPanel` height workaround: each panel owns a screen
 * and scrolls once. The two chips on the main surface open [SettingsPet] and
 * [SettingsModels] directly — the fastest route to a fix is from the thing that
 * told you it was broken.
 *
 * Routes are a sealed hierarchy so a typo is a compile error rather than a tap
 * that silently does nothing.
