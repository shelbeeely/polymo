/**
 * Speech captured on the *pet* rather than the phone.
 *
 * The pet is the source of truth for whether it is recording, and this follows
 * it. A session begins when the pet reports it started listening and ends when
 * it reports it stopped — whoever caused that. Pressing the pet's own talk
 * button and pressing the phone's produce exactly the same sequence here, so
 * there is one code path rather than two that must be kept in agreement.
 *
 * That matters because the pet can now start a conversation on its own. Anything
 * that only reacted to what the *phone* had asked for would miss every utterance
 * the user began by touching the pet — which is the normal way to use it.
 *
 * Transcripts are pushed to [transcripts] rather than returned, since the caller
 * no longer decides when an utterance ends.
