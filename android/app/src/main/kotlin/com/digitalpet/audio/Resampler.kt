/**
 * Sample-rate conversion for the pet's speaker link.
 *
 * The TTS engine synthesises at whatever rate its active voice uses (Piper
 * was fixed at 22050 Hz; the platform engine's varies, commonly 22050 or
 * 24000 Hz), none of which Opus accepts — it takes only 8/12/16/24/48 kHz.
 * The pet's microphone path is already 16 kHz end to end, so TTS is
 * converted *down* to 16 kHz rather than up: speech band is plenty for a
 * speaker this size, it costs a third less airtime, and it leaves exactly
 * one audio format in the system, which is the property that made the
 * uplink easy to reason about.
 *
 * Downsampling needs a low-pass first. Piper's output was measured carrying
 * energy up to 11 kHz — the platform engine's has not been measured the same
 * way, but any voice resampled from a rate this much higher than 16 kHz
 * carries energy well above 8 kHz — and anything above 8 kHz would fold back
 * into the speech band as aliasing: audible as a metallic edge on sibilants,
 * and exactly the kind of damage a listener blames on the codec.
