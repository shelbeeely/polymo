/**
 * Every grant the pet needs, in one list, with what breaks without each.
 *
 * **Why this page exists.** First run asks for these one at a time, at the step
 * that needs them — DESIGN.md §5.2, and that is right. But first run finishes
 * once and for all, and until now it was the ONLY place any of them was ever
 * requested. Three separate faults in one day traced to the same shape: a step
 * skipped, a grant lost, no way back, and nothing on any screen admitting it.
 * Building a recovery row per feature by hand had already been done twice and
 * missed a third. This is the general answer.
 *
 * **It reports; it does not nag.** §5.2 forbids an opening barrage of dialogs,
 * and a page somebody chooses to visit is not that.
 *
 * **THE ONE THING ANDROID WILL NOT DO IS TAKE A PERMISSION BACK.**
 * `revokeSelfPermissionOnKill` exists for runtime permissions on API 33+ and
 * applies by killing the process — here that drops the BLE link, unloads a
 * multi-gigabyte model and costs the ~18 s reload measured on device. The
 * listener binding and the usage-access appop have no revoke API at all. So
 * these are **state rows with an action, not switches**: a switch that cannot
 * go back, or that snaps back after being tapped, is the same lie as a *Loaded*
 * badge over a model that failed.

    /**
     * **Named for the capability, not for the feature.** The first version of
     * this page said "See what arrives" and "Connect to your pet" — the
     * codebase's house voice, which names a thing as its owner would say it,
     * the way [PetFaculty] says "hear you" rather than "Whisper". That voice is
     * right for describing what is BROKEN and wrong for asking someone to grant
     * something: "See what arrives" quietly omits that the app can read every
     * notification on the phone, including its contents. A consent surface has
     * to say the capability plainly enough to be refused.
     *
     * **[allows] is the ceiling, [use] is the floor, and the gap between them is
     * the point.** Android grants usage access for every app on the phone; this
     * one reads the handful you chose. Saying only the narrow half would be
     * flattering and untrue, and saying only the broad half would be alarming
     * and equally untrue. Both, in that order — what you are handing over first,
     * what is done with it second.
