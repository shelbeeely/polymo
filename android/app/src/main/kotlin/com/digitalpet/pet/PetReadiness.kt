/**
 * DESIGN.md §2.1's Axis C, which has been specified since that section was
 * written and represented nowhere.
 *
 * **Its failure mode is silence.** With no models the pet listens, the phone
 * transcribes nothing, and the reply never comes — the documented
 * `SttService not initialised`, visible only in a log. From the outside a
 * perfectly working product looks broken, which is the worst possible first
 * impression for something whose whole premise is that it is alive.
 *
 * **WHEN THIS WINDOW ACTUALLY OPENS — measured, and narrower than it first
 * looked.** Models are singletons, so they are loaded once per PROCESS and
 * survive everything short of the process dying. Verified on device: reopening
 * the app keeps the same pid, reloads nothing, and produces no window at all.
 *
 * So the ~18 s gap belongs to a **fresh process**, not to a reconnect:
 *
 * | Event | Reloads? |
 * |---|---|
 * | Reopening the app | **No** — same process, models still resident |
 * | Pet out of range and back | **No** — the retry machinery keeps the process alive |
 * | Android kills the app for memory | Yes — `START_STICKY` revives the service |
 * | A crash | Yes — same path |
 * | Phone reboot | Nothing runs until the app is opened; there is no BOOT_COMPLETED receiver |
 *
 * The reconnect case only hits it when the process had **already** died, which
 * is why it looked like a reconnect bug. The gap is real and worth closing —
 * during it the pet is connected, listening, and cannot answer — but it is
 * rarer than "every time the pet comes back into range".
