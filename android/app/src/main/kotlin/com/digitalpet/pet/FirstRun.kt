/**
 * First run — DESIGN.md §5.2, the last unbuilt flow.
 *
 * **The sequence is ordered by what breaks first without it**, not by what is
 * easiest to ask for. Without a pet nothing works at all; without models the pet
 * listens, understands and says nothing; without screen-time access the whole
 * sickness mechanic silently does nothing; notifications are a nicety.
 *
 * ### The step is DERIVED, never stored
 *
 * Nothing here remembers "the user is on step 3". The current step is computed
 * from what is actually true — is a pet paired, are the models loaded, is usage
 * access granted — every time it is asked for. That is §5.0 rule 2 applied to a
 * wizard: a stored index is an assertion about the world that stops being true
 * the moment somebody unpairs a pet or deletes a model, and it would send them
 * forward past a step they no longer pass.
 *
 * It also makes the two hand-offs work for free. Steps 2 and 3 cannot be
 * completed inside this flow — pairing happens on the *Your pet* page and models
 * are imported on *Local AI models* — so the flow sends you there and you come
 * back. Because the step is derived, coming back with a pet paired simply *is*
 * progress; nothing has to be told.
 *
 * ### One thing is remembered, and one thing only
 *
 * Whether the flow has been finished or dismissed — see `FirstRunRepository`.
 * Everything else is read from the world.
 *
 * ### Blocked is not the same as skippable, and the wording carries it
 *
 * §5.2's *if declined* column is the whole of it. Steps 2 and 3 **block**: there
 * is no version of this product that works without them, so declining ends the
 * run rather than stepping over it. Steps 4 and 5 **degrade**: the app still
 * works, one named thing stops, and you are offered the step again.
 *
 * **A run that stops at step 2 has still achieved something**, which is why
 * leaving is never a dead end: the main surface already reports every one of
 * these states in the place that fixes it — the two chips, the care card, the
 * usage-access chip on the screen-time page.
