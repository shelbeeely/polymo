/**
 * Owns a conversation with the pet, for the lifetime of the process.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT IN THE VIEWMODEL, which is where all of it used to live:
 *
 * The pet has its own microphone, its own talk button and its own speaker, so a
 * conversation does not involve the phone's screen at all — the user taps the
 * pet, speaks at the pet, and the pet answers. But the pipeline that turns their
 * words into a reply ran in `viewModelScope`, which dies with MainActivity.
 *
 * The failure that caused was silent rather than loud. [PetVoiceRepository] is a
 * singleton and kept capturing and transcribing perfectly; the foreground
 * service kept the BLE link up; and then the finished transcript was published
 * to `transcripts`, a SharedFlow with **replay = 0** whose only subscriber was
 * the ViewModel. With no Activity there was no subscriber, so every transcript
 * was discarded the moment it was produced. The pet listened, understood, and
 * said nothing — until the user opened the app, which recreated the ViewModel
 * and made it work again. That is exactly the state the app lands in whenever
 * the process is restarted without the UI being reopened, which START_STICKY
 * does after any crash.
 *
 * So the conversation is owned here, on a scope that ends only with the process,
 * and [com.digitalpet.service.PetForegroundService] injects it so that it exists
 * whenever the service does. The ViewModel now only observes and forwards.
 *
 * Everything with a UI dependency stays in the ViewModel: the phone's own
 * microphone, model management, BLE pairing, the debug drawer.

     *
     * It is not "clear the pet's memory", because there is nothing to clear:
     * `DEFAULT_HISTORY_MESSAGES` is 0, so no history is sent to the model at all
     * and it starts every turn knowing only the sentence in front of it. That is

     * to invent callbacks. The transcript is a record for the OWNER, not context
     * for the model.
     *
     * It also does not clear the pet's own screen. The pet holds its last
     * message indefinitely by design, and that message is on a different device
     * — wiping a phone record should not reach across the wire and blank the
     * thing on the shelf.
     *
     * ### Why it refuses mid-generation
     *
     * A reply already streaming would land in the emptied transcript a moment
     * later and look like the clear had failed. Refusing is honest and the wait
