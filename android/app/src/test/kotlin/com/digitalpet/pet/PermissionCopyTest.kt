/**
 * The Permissions page is a CONSENT surface, and its copy is checkable.
 *
 * The page shipped once in the codebase's ordinary house voice — "See what
 * arrives", "Connect to your pet" — which names a thing as its owner would say
 * it. That is right for saying what is broken and wrong for asking somebody to
 * hand over a capability: "See what arrives" omits that the app can read every
 * notification on the phone. These tests pin the properties that stop it
 * drifting back.
 *
 * One of them reads `AndroidManifest.xml`, which puts it with `ContrastTest`
 * and `TokenSyncTest` in the small set that check something a compiler cannot:
 * **a sentence on screen against the fact it claims.**
