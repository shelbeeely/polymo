/**
 * [Resampler] converts the TTS engine's output rate (commonly 22050 or
 * 24000 Hz — Piper's was fixed at 22050, the platform engine's varies by
 * voice) to the 16 kHz the pet decodes.
 *
 * Worth testing because it is pure arithmetic sitting in the audio path where
 * mistakes are inaudible individually and ruinous in aggregate: a wrong length
 * shifts pitch, a missing low-pass folds sibilance back into the speech band,
 * and an overshooting filter clips peaks that were fine on the way in.
