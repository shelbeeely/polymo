 *
 * Design notes:
 *  - Text/Mood are readable so a reconnecting client can resync instead of
 *    guessing what the pet is currently showing.
 *  - Info is read FIRST by the client: it announces which features this
 *    firmware actually has, so app and firmware can version independently.
 *  - v2 adds the mic path. Capture is *gated*: the pet records only between an
 *    explicit START and STOP, so it is not listening (or draining a battery)
 *    the rest of the time. There is no on-device wake word and no touch button
 *    (see the FT3168 note in pet-esp32.c), so the phone drives it.
 *  - Frames are streamed as they are encoded rather than buffered into one
 *    blob and sent at the end: transfer then overlaps with speaking, so the
 *    utterance is almost entirely delivered by the time the user stops. It is
 *    still not a realtime link — nothing depends on any single frame's latency.
 *  - v3 adds the speaker path, deliberately mirroring the mic path: same rate,
 *    same frame duration, same [seq]+packet framing. One audio format exists in
 *    this system, which is what made the uplink easy to reason about.
 *  - The link is HALF-DUPLEX by design. Driving the speaker raises the mic's
 *    noise floor by ~28 dB (measured), on top of the acoustic echo between two
 *    transducers centimetres apart. The phone owns both ends so it simply never
 *    overlaps them, and the firmware refuses either way round as a backstop.

/* ---- v4: expression, status and condition are three different things ------
 *
 * Until v4 the Mood byte carried two of them and could not carry the third.

 * unrelated meanings — and neither could ever say "sick" or "dead", because
 * those are not moods and, when the link is down, nothing can be sent at all.
 *
 * So:
 *   Mood       (0x03)  EXPRESSION. Phone -> pet, transient, decays. Unchanged,
 *                      which is why v4 does not break a v3 phone's chat path.
 *   Status     (0x14)  What the PHONE is doing. Phone -> pet, persists until
 *                      changed. "Thinking" belongs here, not in Mood.
 *   Condition  (0x15)  How the PET is. Pet -> phone, read + notify. The pet
 *                      owns this (DESIGN.md §1 decision 1); the phone reads it,
 *                      which is what lets the LLM speak from the pet's state.

 *   wire, and none of it is the phone's to decide.
 *
 * This is a LEVEL, not an edge, and the phone re-asserts it on every poll. Two
 * reasons. An edge that goes missing (a dropped write, a link that came back
 * without the phone noticing) would strand the pet sick forever, which is the
 * same class of bug as a stuck playback flag, where one lost end-of-utterance
 * left the pet refusing every later recording. And a level lets
 * the pet time out on its own: no report for PET_SCREEN_STALE_HINT_SEC means
 * the phone is gone, not that the user is still scrolling.
